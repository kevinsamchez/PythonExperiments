Hi! I’m Kevin, a product manager, pharmacist and health informatician working to improve patient safety by bridging the divide between technology and healthcare. I am interested in applying clinical analytics to improve health outcomes and the clinician experience.

This repo is where I tinker with python coding problems and learning to code. My current aspiration is to build SMART on FHIR apps.

Thanks for visiting!
